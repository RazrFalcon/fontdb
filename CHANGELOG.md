## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Tests for Database::query. [@lhinderberger](https://github.com/lhinderberger)

## [0.11.2] - 2023-01-10
### Added
- Implement `Display` trait for `ID`. [@7sDream](https://github.com/7sDream)

## [0.11.1] - 2022-12-26
### Fixed
- Always prefer _Typographic Family_ to _Family Name_ when available.
  [@CryZe](https://github.com/CryZe)
- Prevent duplicated family names.

## [0.11.0] - 2022-12-25
### Added
- Support localized family names.
- Improve fontconfig support. [@declantsien](https://github.com/declantsien)

### Changed
- `FaceInfo::family` was replaced with `FaceInfo::families` and contains a list of family
  names now.

### Fixed
- Improve family name detection in variable fonts.

## [0.10.0] - 2022-11-08
### Added
- `no_std` support. [@jackpot51](https://github.com/jackpot51)

## [0.9.3] - 2022-10-26

## [0.9.2] - 2022-10-22
### Added

- `ID::dummy`

### Fixed
- Expand home path `~` prefix during fontconfig paths resolving.
  [@snoyer](https://github.com/snoyer)

## [0.9.1] - 2022-02-21
### Changed
- Reduce binary size by 10% using less generic code.
- Simplify Database::query implementation.

## [0.9.0] - 2022-02-20
### Added
- Way faster fonts scanning by using a more low-level `ttf-parser` API
  which allows us to parse only required TrueType tables.
  On my hardware, `load_system_fonts()` loaded 898 fonts in 9ms instead of 11ms in the release mode
  and in 35ms instead of 52ms in debug.
  Currently, we're parsing only `name`, `OS/2` and `post` tables.

## [0.8.0] - 2022-02-12
### Added
- Load user fonts on Windows.
- `fontconfig` feature to allow retrieving font dirs from the fontconfig config file
  instead of using hardcoded paths. Linux-only. [@Riey](https://github.com/Riey)

## [0.7.0] - 2021-10-04
### Changed
- The `Source` enum has a new variant `SharedFile`, used for unsafe persistent
  memory mappings.
- `FaceInfo` stores `Source` directly now, not anymore in an `Arc`. Instead `Source::Binary`
  now stores an `Arc` of the data.

## [0.6.2] - 2021-09-04
### Fixed
- Fix compilation without the `fs` feature.

## [0.6.1] - 2021-09-04
### Changed
- Split the `fs` build feature into `fs` and `memmap`. [@neinseg](https://github.com/neinseg)

## [0.6.0] - 2021-08-21
### Added
- Search in `$HOME/.fonts` on Linux. [@Linus789](https://github.com/Linus789)

### Changed
- Generic font families are preset by default instead of being set to `None`.

## [0.5.4] - 2021-05-25
### Added
- Implement `Eq`, `Hash` for `Query`, `Family`, `Weight` and `Style`.
