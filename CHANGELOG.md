## [0.16.0] - 2023-10-31

## [0.15.0] - 2023-10-01

  [@declantsien](https://github.com/@declantsien)

## [0.14.1] - 2023-05-10

### Changed
- `Database::load_font_source()` returns a list of loaded face IDs now.
  [@notgull](https://github.com/notgull)
- `ttf-parser` and `memmap2` dependencies update.

## [0.13.1] - 2023-04-23

  [@7sDream](https://github.com/7sDream)
- Improve downloadable fonts detection on macOS. [@messense](https://github.com/messense)

## [0.13.0] - 2023-02-21
### Added
- `Database::default()`. [@7sDream](https://github.com/7sDream)

### Changed
- Database uses `slotmap::SlotMap` instead of `Vec` as an internal storage now.
  This allows us to have O(1) indexing by `ID` by sacrificing faces iteration speed a bit.
  [@7sDream](https://github.com/7sDream)
- `Database::remove_face` no longer returns `bool`.
- `Database::faces` returns an Iterator and not a slice now.

### Added

### Fixed
- Expand home path `~` prefix during fontconfig paths resolving.
  [@snoyer](https://github.com/snoyer)

## [0.9.1] - 2022-02-21
### Changed
- Reduce binary size by 10% using less generic code.
- Simplify Database::query implementation.

## [0.9.0] - 2022-02-20
### Added
- Way faster fonts scanning by using a more low-level `ttf-parser` API
  which allows us to parse only required TrueType tables.
  On my hardware, `load_system_fonts()` loaded 898 fonts in 9ms instead of 11ms in the release mode
  and in 35ms instead of 52ms in debug.
  Currently, we're parsing only `name`, `OS/2` and `post` tables.

## [0.8.0] - 2022-02-12
### Added
- Load user fonts on Windows.
- `fontconfig` feature to allow retrieving font dirs from the fontconfig config file
  instead of using hardcoded paths. Linux-only. [@Riey](https://github.com/Riey)

## [0.7.0] - 2021-10-04
### Changed
- The `Source` enum has a new variant `SharedFile`, used for unsafe persistent
  memory mappings.
- `FaceInfo` stores `Source` directly now, not anymore in an `Arc`. Instead `Source::Binary`
  now stores an `Arc` of the data.

## [0.6.2] - 2021-09-04
### Fixed
- Fix compilation without the `fs` feature.

## [0.6.1] - 2021-09-04
### Changed
- Split the `fs` build feature into `fs` and `memmap`. [@neinseg](https://github.com/neinseg)

## [0.6.0] - 2021-08-21
### Added
- Search in `$HOME/.fonts` on Linux. [@Linus789](https://github.com/Linus789)

### Changed
- Generic font families are preset by default instead of being set to `None`.

## [0.5.4] - 2021-05-25
### Added
- Implement `Eq`, `Hash` for `Query`, `Family`, `Weight` and `Style`.
  [@dhardy](https://github.com/dhardy)

## [0.5.1] - 2020-12-20

## [0.5.0] - 2020-12-20
### Added
- `FaceInfo::post_script_name`
- `FaceInfo::monospaced`
- `Database::load_system_fonts`

## [0.4.0] - 2020-12-06

## [0.3.0] - 2020-12-05

## [0.2.0] - 2020-07-21
### Changed
